# Closing and next steps

All right! We have covered different topics related with the operations with Serverless technologies. However, there are a lot of different topics that worth discussion. We provide more guidance on the [Wild Rydes Workshop](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-workshops/tree/master/DevOps) about multi-stage pipeline, uni-testing an API, analyze and debug the Unicorn API to dive a bit deeper into ServerlessOps.

Let's finish this workshop by cleaining all the resources:

1. Go to CloudFormation Console.
2. Select **ServerlessOps-stack** > *Actions* and *Delete stack*.
3. Select **ServerlessOps-step0-stack** > *Actions* and *Delete stack*.
